# GFE Introduction

## Introduction to GFE

HLA genotyping via next generation sequencing (NGS) poses challenges for the use of HLA allele names to analyze and discuss sequence polymorphism. NGS will identify many new synonymous and non-coding HLA sequence variants. Allele names identify the types of nucleotide polymorphism that define an allele (non-synonymous, synonymous and non-coding changes), but do not describe how polymorphism is distributed among the individual features (the flanking untranslated regions, exons and introns) of a gene. Further, HLA alleles cannot be named in the absence of antigen-recognition domain (ARD) encoding exons. Here, a system for describing HLA polymorphism in terms of HLA gene features (GFs) is proposed. This system enumerates the unique nucleotide sequences for each GF in an HLA gene, and records these in a GF enumeration notation that allows both more granular dissection of allele-level HLA polymorphism and the discussion and analysis of GFs in the absence of ARD-encoding exon sequences.

## Approach

The unique sequences in each gene feature of a given HLA gene can be sequentially numbered, and applied to construct a new name for that allele consisting of one field for each GF, containing the unique number for that GF nucleotide sequence and delimited by dashes, prefaced with the allele name followed by a ‘w’ (for Workshop) to identify the provisional nature of this notation.

Example:
The HLA-A gene has 8 exons.  To represent the sequence of a variant of this genes involves determination of the 17 features: 3’UTR, 8 exons, 7 introns, 5’UTR. The allele named `HLA-A*01:01:01:01` has a corresponding sequence which can be aligned and [[annotated|GFE Annotation]] and the 17 numbers can be joined by hyphens to produce the string `HLA-Aw2-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-1-4`.
